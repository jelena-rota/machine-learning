House prices dataset was assembled and published by Dean De Cock. It is a set of 2'930 observations with 82 attributes each. 

First 2'430 observations are used as a training set to fit and evaluate different models, that will be later used to make predictions for the last 500 ones (test set). Prices for these 500 houses are not provided.

The project contains all main data science steps, such as preparing the data, exploring the data (EDA) and modelling.
